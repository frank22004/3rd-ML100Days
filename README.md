﻿﻿﻿﻿# **﻿3rd-ML100Days**The 3 round of the 100 days marathon on machine learning5. Day5: learn how to splice the sentence at every colume of a dataset by `` .splice()``8. Day8: ``hist()``10. Day10: learn how to use `.clip` to tricate the range of data. Hint: `.clip` contains the data on the broaderline.11. Day11: Here are two method to calculate mode in Python. One is the `from scipy.stats import mode`. The other is to count the most quantity number.13.  Day13: `cut()`  is to divide the data into several interval based on the bins, which exclud the lower bondary but includ the upper bondary.14.  Day14: using `corrcoef(x,y)` to analysis the correlation index of two array from `numpy` 15. Day15: using `pandas.corr()` to calculate the correlation index within a data frame16. Day16: using `seaborn.distplot()` or `seaborn.kdeplot()` to plot a Kernel Density Estimation17. Day17: using `pandas.cut()` to group the data by `bin =`, which is a list of boundaries within the data
